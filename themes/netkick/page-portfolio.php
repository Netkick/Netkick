				<h1><span>Case Studies</span></h1>
				<p>Here you find some of the projects that Netkick has delivered.</p>

				<h1><span>Yawara Martial Arts</span></h1>
				<img class="portfolio_screenshot" src="<?php echo site_url('images/portfolio_yawara_screenshot.jpg'); ?>" alt="Yawara Martial Arts" style="float:right">
				<p>Yawara Martial Arts has three clubs, two in Woking and one in Wandsworth, where they teach Judo and Karate. Yawara Martial Arts has been in business for over 25 years and is run by Sensei Dave Clarke. Sensei Dave is a full time martial arts instructor who started with Judo in 1969 at the age of six. Yawara Martial Arts was hit hard by the economic downturn, like many other businesses, and suffered from a significant reduction in the number of active students. Relying mainly on paper flyers to promote the clubs Sensei Dave was unaware of the value a strong Internet presence can bring and although he has had a website for many years it was old, wasn't properly maintained and didn't work well on mobile devices.</p>
				<p>Sensei Dave sought advise from Netkick and after an initial discussion we agreed that we would work together to modernise and improve his website, include the clubs in local Internet business directories, improve his search ranking on Google, and create an online presence on places like Google Maps and Facebook.</p>
				<p>Since the launch of the new website in October 2013 the work we have done together has had a major impact on his business. Every month new faces are showing up at classes, so many that Sensei Dave has started to think about adding more sessions to meet the increasing demand!</p>

				<h1><span>Rocking Your Role</span></h1>

				<p>Jenny Garett  is an executive coach and author of Rocking Your Role, the how to guide to success for female breadwinners. She is also a sought after speaker for conferences and corporate events.  She asked Netkick for help as she wanted her site to be responsive. She wanted to make sure that whatever device her potential clients were viewing the site from that their view would be optimised.</p>
				<p>Netkick helped her modernized her existing site to provide a more contemporary and professional look and feel and made it responsive for clients with different devices or on the go. We restructured the site so Jenny could easily maintain dynamic areas on her own after the launch. Jenny writes a lot of blogs, take part and organise many events so this was critical to her business to quickly and effectively make those updates independently.</p>
				<p>Jenny was very complimentary of Netkick’s work and kindly wrote a recommendation letter explaining how “her expectations were surpassed in so many ways”. She specifically mentioned the project management and  communication throughout, the layman’s terms so she didn't feel overwhelmed with tech talk and most importantly the fact that  she felt in charge of the outcome and the pace of progress, which was very important to her as a business owner!</p>
